# TheGambler — Rebrand Spec
_Added: 2026-02-26 | Target audience: 25-30 year old guys, golf + gambling_

## Brand Direction

**Vibe:** Vegas meets Augusta. High-stakes golf weekend energy.  
Think: clean luxury casino + modern golf + lads weekend.  
NOT: old-school country club. NOT: cartoonish gambling.

## Color Palette

Primary palette:
- **Deep Black:** `#0A0A0A` — main backgrounds
- **Emerald Green:** `#00C853` — primary actions, CTAs, success states, money
- **Gold:** `#FFD700` — champions, trophies, premium elements, wins
- **Warm White:** `#F5F5F5` — primary text
- **Slate Gray:** `#1C1C1E` — card backgrounds, secondary surfaces
- **Muted Gray:** `#3A3A3C` — borders, dividers

Accent:
- **Red:** `#FF3B30` — danger, losses, delete actions
- **Amber:** `#FF9500` — warnings, side bets, in-progress

NO MORE: purple gradients, blue gradients, generic dark teal

## Typography

- **Headings:** Bold, uppercase or title case — authoritative
- **Numbers/Stats:** Tabular numbers, prominent sizing
- **Tournament name:** "THE GAMBLER" in wide-tracked all-caps everywhere it appears
- Use existing font stack but lean into weight contrast (900 weight for hero text, 400 for body)

## Design Language

### Cards
- Black backgrounds (`#0A0A0A` or `#1C1C1E`)
- Thin gold or green accent borders on featured/active cards
- Subtle inner glow on hover (green for positive, gold for champions)
- Sharp corners OR very slightly rounded (4px max) — no bubbly UI

### Buttons
- Primary: Solid emerald green `#00C853`, black text, bold
- Secondary: Transparent with green border
- Danger: Solid red
- Money/payment actions: Gold gradient with black text
- All caps text on buttons

### Leaderboard / Tables
- Alternating `#0A0A0A` / `#1C1C1E` rows
- Gold `#FFD700` for 1st place row (subtle left border + text tint)
- Silver `#C0C0C0` for 2nd
- Bronze `#CD7F32` for 3rd
- Green numbers for scores under par, red for over
- Monospace/tabular numbers for all scores

### Navigation
- Black bar, minimal
- Active item: green underline or left border
- Logo: "🎰 THE GAMBLER" or custom golf/gambling icon combo

### Icons
- Use Lucide icons (already installed) — keep minimal
- Golf hole flag emoji 🏌️ or ⛳ for golf contexts
- 🎰 for betting/gambling contexts
- 🏆 for leaderboard/champions
- 💰 for money/payments

### Scorecards
- Inspired by real golf scorecards — clean grid
- Par row in gray, player scores color-coded vs par
- Eagle: double underline gold
- Birdie: green circle
- Par: plain white
- Bogey: red
- Double+: red bold

### Betting Marketplace
- Dark casino table green `#1B5E20` as accent background
- Chip-style bet amount badges
- "POT: $XXX" in gold, large
- Active bets pulse animation (subtle)

### Registration / Payment
- Big clear price display: "**$150**" in gold, prominent
- Progress steps for multi-step payment
- Confirmation screen: ✅ green checkmark, "YOU'RE IN" hero text

## Specific Pages to Redesign

### Home / Dashboard
- Hero section: Tournament name, date, location — massive
- "THE GAMBLER 2025" in huge tracked caps with subtitle
- Quick stats: Registered players, prize pool, days until tournament
- CTA buttons: "Register Now" (gold), "View Leaderboard" (green)

### Leaderboard
- Full-width table, podium animation for top 3 on load
- Each player row: avatar/initials bubble + name + scores + total
- Expandable row: shows hole-by-hole scorecard

### Betting Page
- "THE BOOK" as the page title
- Open bets displayed as betting slips (card styled like a casino slip)
- Total pot displayed prominently

### Admin Dashboard  
- "TOURNAMENT CONTROL" header
- Financial summary cards: Entry fees collected, CTP pools, Betting pots
- Clean data tables

## Animation / Motion

Keep it subtle but impactful:
- Score saves: brief green flash
- Champion reveal: gold shimmer/pulse
- Leaderboard rank change: slide animation
- Payment success: confetti or chip animation
- Loading states: skeleton screens (dark themed)

## Mobile Considerations

- Bottom navigation bar for mobile (5 main tabs)
- Large tap targets (min 48px)
- Scorecard entry: Big number buttons, easy to tap drunk
- Shot tracker: Full-screen with massive "LOG SHOT" button

## What to Remove / Clean Up
- Remove any purple/blue gradient backgrounds
- Remove generic gray card styling
- Remove any "beta" or placeholder UI
- Clean up any Replit branding remnants
- Make all loading states consistent (dark skeleton)
