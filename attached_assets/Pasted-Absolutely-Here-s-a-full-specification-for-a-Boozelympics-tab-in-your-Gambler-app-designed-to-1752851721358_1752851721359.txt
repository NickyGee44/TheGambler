### 🔁 Follow-Up Prompts

**Q1:** Should we log Boozelympics results to player profiles just like golf rounds?
**Q2:** Want an admin form to dynamically add games, assign point values, or edit results?
**Q3:** Should we generate randomized matchups for each game or let teams challenge each other?
**Q4:** Do you want a “Boozelympian of the Year” award shown on profiles long term?
**Q5:** Should I wireframe this layout or prep a Google Sheet version for planning?

Let me know how far you want to take this—I’ll keep it as party-focused or deep as you like 🍻
