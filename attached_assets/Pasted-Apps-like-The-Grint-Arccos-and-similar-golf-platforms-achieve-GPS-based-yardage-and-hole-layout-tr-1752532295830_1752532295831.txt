Apps like The Grint, Arccos, and similar golf platforms achieve GPS-based yardage and hole layout tracking by combining satellite mapping, GIS data, and device-level GPS tracking. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of how you can replicate a similar system in your app, particularly for Deerhurst Highlands and Muskoka Bay.

🧭 Summary Table

Component	Description	How to Implement
📡 GPS Tracking	Uses the player’s smartphone GPS chip	Access via native Android/iOS SDKs
🗺️ Satellite Mapping	Pulls aerial views of courses	Integrate Google Maps API or Mapbox
🧾 Course Mapping	Stores hole data, green coordinates, hazards	Manually create or license GIS course data
📏 Yardage Calculation	Calculates real-time distances	Use Haversine formula or built-in SDK functions
🧠 Data Layers	Add overlays like hazards, fairways, greens	Create vector layers on top of base maps
🏌️ Shot Tracking	Stores where each shot is taken	Combine GPS with UI shot-logging or club sensors

🔧 How It Works

1. GPS Signal from Phone
	•	The app continuously pulls the phone’s latitude/longitude.
	•	iOS and Android provide high-precision GPS access (especially newer iPhones with dual-band GPS).
	•	Use Cases: Real-time distance to pin, tee box location, shot logging.

2. Course Mapping (Vector Data Layer)
	•	Either license existing GIS data or map manually:
	•	Mark tee box, center of green, back/middle/front of green, hazards, bunkers.
	•	Each hole should be a polyline or polygon with coordinates.
	•	Tools:
	•	Golfzon, Arccos, 18Birdies, BlueGolf use proprietary or licensed data.
	•	You can use OpenStreetMap with added golf tags.

For your app: Hire someone to map Deerhurst Highlands and Muskoka Bay in QGIS or Mapbox Studio using public satellite imagery + course scorecards.

3. Satellite Imagery Layer
	•	Use either:
	•	Google Maps SDK (easiest, best coverage, license cost scales with usage)
	•	Mapbox (highly customizable, cost-effective for low-volume apps)
	•	This allows zoom/pan and player location overlay.

4. Distance/Yardage Engine
	•	Compute the real-time distance from current GPS to the green, hazards, etc.
	•	Two methods:
	•	Haversine formula: distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
	•	Google Maps Distance Matrix API (if you want precise paths)
	•	Add features like:
	•	“Plays like” yardage (elevation, wind—optional)
	•	Auto-club suggestions (based on past performance)

5. Hole-by-Hole Layout
	•	Show a minimap of the current hole with:
	•	Current position
	•	Green (circle)
	•	Hazards (icons)
	•	Club recommendations
	•	Optional: upload or draw hole layouts in SVG and render over map layer.

🧠 Additional Features You Could Add

✅ Auto-Hole Detection
	•	Based on distance moved + tee location, auto-switch to the next hole.

📊 Shot Logging
	•	Let players input clubs and result.
	•	Save GPS location per shot.

🧮 Handicap-Aware Scorecard
	•	Preload strokes gained or lost per hole.
	•	Use existing Grint logic: net score = gross – course handicap.

🍻 Alcohol Adjustment Mode (for your trip)
	•	Set a rule: “1 drink = -1 net stroke” and dynamically show match adjustment per player.

🛠️ Tech Stack Suggestion

Feature	Stack
GPS Tracking	React Native + Expo Location / Swift CoreLocation / Android FusedLocationProvider
Maps	Mapbox GL JS or Google Maps SDK
Course Data	JSON/GIS manual mapping per hole
Backend	Firebase or Supabase (easy real-time sync)
Analytics	Segment + PostHog or Helika-style dashboards

💰 Licensing Notes
	•	Google Maps: Free up to 28,000 map loads/month. Beyond that, ~$7/1,000 loads.
	•	Mapbox: Free up to 50,000 map loads/month (good for MVP).
	•	Arccos-like features (club sensors + AI shot detection): You’d need to integrate with Bluetooth sensors or phone accelerometer data, which is a separate scope.

🧭 Getting Course Coordinates

Use apps or tools like:
	•	Google Earth Pro – Free and allows you to extract Lat/Lng coordinates.
	•	Mapbox Studio – Draw greens, fairways, tee boxes.
	•	QGIS – Open-source GIS software.

✅ Final Recommendation

Start simple:
	1.	Use Mapbox or Google Maps to display a satellite view.
	2.	Manually plot tee and green locations for each hole at Deerhurst and Muskoka Bay.
	3.	Track user’s GPS in real-time and display distance to green.
	4.	Add stroke rules and shot inputs later.
