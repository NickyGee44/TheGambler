Here is an updated **prompt for Replit** that incorporates your **long-term goal** of building a historical performance tracker and "Gambler performance card" for each golfer across **multiple years** of the tournament.

---

### 🧾 Prompt to Replit (copy-paste this for development):

---

I’m building a golf tournament tracking app called **The Gambler**, which runs every year. The core idea is to track and display **per-hole stats across 3 rounds** for each golfer, and accumulate these into a long-term **performance card** for every participant.

---

### 🧠 Core Requirements

#### 1. Per-Hole Stat Tracking (as previously described)

Each golfer can input the following stats **per hole**:

* `score` (number)
* `GIR` (green in regulation, boolean)
* `FIR` (fairway in regulation, boolean)
* `putts` (number)
* `penalties` (number)
* `drive_direction` (enum: left, center, right)
* `sand_save` (boolean)
* `up_and_down` (boolean; implied if GIR is false and putts = 1)

These stats are entered hole-by-hole during **Round 1, 2, and 3**.

Each hole’s data is saved locally and must persist between hole navigation:

* `Next` and `Previous` buttons should load the correct hole’s saved data.
* If no data exists for that hole, the default view should be empty.

---

#### 2. **Stats Page** (per Golfer, Aggregated)

For each golfer, display their **total stats across all 3 rounds**, including:

* Total score
* Avg GIR %
* Avg FIR %
* Total putts
* Total penalties
* Drive direction breakdown (e.g. 45% left, 40% center, 15% right)
* Sand save % (successful saves / sand entries)
* Up and down % (successful saves when missing green)

This allows us to compare golfers' **performance over the weekend**.

---

#### 3. **Player Profiles & History**

Each golfer should have a **profile** that stores:

* Name
* Handicap (editable by admin or on player entry)
* Pairing history (team partner each year)
* Scores & stats **per round per year**
* Accumulated stats across all historical tournaments

Example data structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Nick Grossi",
  "handicap": 15,
  "history": {
    "2025": {
      "rounds": {
        "1": { "hole_stats": {...}, "totals": {...} },
        "2": { ... },
        "3": { ... }
      },
      "team": "Connor Patterson",
      "final_points": 18,
      "ranking": "3rd"
    },
    "2024": { ... },
    ...
  }
}
```

---

### 🔐 Optional Back-End Storage Options

If needed, I’m open to using:

* Supabase or Firebase (preferred)
* LocalStorage (for MVP)
* MongoDB Atlas
* Flat file JSON store if backend isn't ready

---

### 🧱 Additional Notes

* Eventually, the **"Stats" page** should be able to:

  * Filter by year
  * Compare players side-by-side
  * View lifetime performance
* Would like to implement a **"Gambler Scorecard"** page that shows their all-time rankings, past partners, and trends.

---

Let me know when the above is done, and I’ll guide the next version with full leaderboard charts, charts by round, and more advanced stat tracking.

Let me know if you want a database schema or React state outline for this next.
