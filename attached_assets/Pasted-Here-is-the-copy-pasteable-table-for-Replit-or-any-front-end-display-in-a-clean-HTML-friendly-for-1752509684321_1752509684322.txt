⚙️ Integration Tips for Replit

If you’re using React, structure this data as an array of objects:

const matchups = [
  {
    foursome: "Foursome 1",
    matchup: "Jordan Kreller vs Christian Hauck",
    holes: "1–6",
    strokes: "Christian gives Jordan 0 strokes"
  },
  {
    foursome: "Foursome 1",
    matchup: "Jordan Kreller vs Connor Patterson",
    holes: "7–12",
    strokes: "Connor gives Jordan 1 stroke"
  },
  // ...continue through all matchups
];

Let me know if you want:
	•	Auto-score logic based on strokes
	•	A modal UI to enter hole-by-hole results
	•	Drinking multiplier per hole
	•	Side bets scoreboard tied to matchups

Q1: Should I now build out the React or HTML prototype for your Replit?
Q2: Want each team’s overall record tracked on this page?
Q3: Should the strokes be auto-applied to entered scores for net results?
Q4: Want me to generate a print-friendly scorecard version?
Q5: Should I help you host this publicly via Replit’s live deployment?
