Here is the corrected set of **Round 3 Matchups** with proper **stroke advantages**:

✅ **Clarified Rule:**

> *The higher handicap player gets strokes against the lower handicap player.*
> *Strokes given = ⌊(Handicap Difference ÷ 3)⌋ → max 6 strokes per 6-hole match.*

For each 1v1 match, **the player receiving strokes is the worse (higher handicap) player**, and the strokes are applied to the **hardest holes** in the 6-hole segment.

### 🧠 What This Looks Like In-App (Replit Dev Instructions):

* Show each 6-hole match with:

  * **Both players' names and HCPs**
  * **How many strokes are given** and **who receives them**
  * **Which holes** strokes apply to (based on that 6-hole segment’s hardest holes)
* On a hole where a stroke is given, show it clearly:

  > *Example: “Nick G receives 1 stroke on Hole 5 (HCP 1)”*

### Want this as a structured export?

I can output this as:

* ✅ JSON
* ✅ CSV / Excel
* ✅ Firestore document setup for Firebase
* ✅ Static HTML table for use in app

Let me know your preference.

### 🔁 Follow-Up Options:

**Q1:** Want me to auto-assign stroke holes using the hole-by-hole HCP ranking for Deerhurst and Muskoka Bay?
**Q2:** Should I generate this as part of your player matchups page with “Live Scoring” functionality?
**Q3:** Do you want these matchups logged to each player’s tournament history card automatically?
**Q4:** Should we randomize matchups each year but maintain fairness based on HCP tiers?
**Q5:** Want me to version this as JSON now for Replit import?
