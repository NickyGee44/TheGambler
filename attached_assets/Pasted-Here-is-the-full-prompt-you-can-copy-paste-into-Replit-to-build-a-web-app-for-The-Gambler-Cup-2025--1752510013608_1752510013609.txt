🟡 2. Tournament Format + Rules

There are 3 rounds. Each team has 2 players. Each round scores points toward the team’s total.

⸻

Round 1 – Best Ball (Net) – 10 Points Max
	•	Each team records the best net score per hole between the 2 players.
	•	At the end of the round, compare total team net scores.
	•	Points awarded by placement:

Place	Points
1st	10
2nd	8
3rd	6
4th	5
5th	4
6th	3
7th	2
8th	1



Drinking Rule:
	•	Any birdie or better: opposing team must finish their drink.

⸻

Round 2 – Scramble (Net) – 10 Points Max
	•	Teams choose best shot each time; both hit from that spot.
	•	Team handicap: 35% of lower HCP + 15% of higher HCP
	•	Net team score ranked vs all others.
	•	Same point structure as Round 1.

Drinking Rule:
	•	Each time your shot isn’t chosen, take a sip.

⸻

Round 3 – 6-Hole Match Play (Net) – 24 Points Max

This round is worth DOUBLE POINTS and is individual-based but adds to team total.
	•	Each player plays 3× six-hole net matches vs everyone in their foursome (1v1).
	•	Scoring per player:
	•	Win = 2 points
	•	Tie = 1 point
	•	Loss = 0 points
	•	Max 6 points per player
	•	Max 12 per team

Drink Handicap Modifier:
	•	All players begin with a net +18
	•	For each drink consumed, subtract 1 stroke from net (max -6)

Example Matchup Stroke Assignment Rule:
	•	If Player A is 6 HCP, Player B is 12 → B gets 2 strokes across 6 holes
	•	If >18 HCP difference, allow 2 strokes per hole max

Drinking Rule:
	•	Drinks consumed lower your starting net score
	•	Bonus fun, but also makes drinking a strategic choice

⸻

🔴 3. Final Leaderboard Calculation
	•	Team total =
Round1_Points + Round2_Points + Round3_Player1 + Round3_Player2
	•	Display final leaderboard with:
	•	Team Rank
	•	Team Members
	•	Total Points
	•	Highlight Winning Team in Gold

Would you like me to generate:
	•	The JSON schema for the tournament data?
	•	A side-bet tracker entry modal?
	•	Individual player scorecards by round?
