Here's a clean and technical prompt you can give Replit (or post in Replit AI if using their assistant), explaining exactly what you want your golf scoring app to do regarding **per-hole stat tracking with memory between holes**:

### 🧾 Prompt to Replit (copy-paste this):

---

I want to build a **hole-by-hole stat tracking interface** for my golf app on Replit. Here’s what I need:

---

### 🎯 Core Functionality:

1. **Per-hole data structure:**

   * For each hole (1–18), I want to store:

     * `score` (numeric)
     * `GIR` (green in regulation, boolean)
     * `FIR` (fairway in regulation, boolean)
     * `putts` (numeric)
     * `penalties` (numeric)
     * `drive_direction` (options: left, center, right)
     * `sand_save` (boolean)
     * `up_and_down` (boolean – optional but implied if GIR = false and putts = 1)

2. **UI Behavior:**

   * The player starts on **Hole 1**.
   * When stats are entered and the user presses “Next Hole”, the data for **Hole 1** should be saved.
   * When arriving on **Hole 2**, the form should:

     * Show a **clean slate** (default state: 0s and unclicked toggles)
     * Unless data for Hole 2 was already saved — in which case, load that data into the form.
   * When pressing “Previous Hole”, it should show the data that was saved for that hole and allow editing.

---

### 💾 Storage:

* Store all per-hole data in a single state object (ideally using React `useState` or a global state store like Zustand or Redux).
* Example structure:

```js
{
  1: { score: 4, GIR: true, FIR: true, putts: 2, penalties: 0, drive_direction: "left", sand_save: false, up_and_down: false },
  2: { score: 5, GIR: false, FIR: false, putts: 1, penalties: 1, drive_direction: "right", sand_save: true, up_and_down: true },
  ...
}
```

---

### 🛠️ UI Elements Needed:

* Hole navigation (`Previous`, `Next`, hole # display)
* Input components:

  * Score (number input)
  * GIR toggle
  * FIR toggle
  * Putts (number input)
  * Penalties (number input)
  * Drive Direction (3-way toggle or buttons: L/C/R)
  * Sand Save (toggle)
  * Up and Down (auto-detect or optional toggle if needed)

---

### 🔄 Requirements:

* **Data persists** as the user navigates between holes.
* **Auto-save or manual save** after input (either is fine).
* When revisiting a hole, **restore all previously saved data** for that hole.
* If a hole has no data saved yet, **all fields should show default values**.

Let me know if you need help wiring this with React state, localStorage, or syncing to a backend like Supabase/MongoDB — we may want to persist scores beyond a single session later.

---

### Bonus features for later:

* Summary page after 18 holes
* Export to CSV
* Sync to account / cloud

Let me know once that’s built and I’ll help expand it.
