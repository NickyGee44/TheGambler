### 🧩 Event Breakdown

#### 🏌️‍♂️ 1. Wedge Shot Challenge (Chug Time Based on Distance)

* Player flops a wedge shot aiming to land near a target zone.

* Zones are measured from the starting spot:

  | Distance from target zone | Chug Time            |
  | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | <1 ft                     | 10 sec               |
  | 1–2 ft                    | 9 sec                |
  | 2–3 ft                    | 8 sec                |
  | 3–4 ft                    | 7 sec                |
  | 4–5 ft                    | 6 sec                |
  | 5–6 ft                    | 5 sec                |
  | 6–7 ft                    | 4 sec                |
  | 7–8 ft                    | 3 sec                |
  | 8–9 ft                    | 2 sec                |
  | 9–10 ft                   | 1 sec                |
  | >10 ft                    | Finish full drink 🍺 |

* **Admin enters** distance manually into the app (e.g. 2.5 ft), and the app auto-calculates chug time.

---

#### 🔄 2. Flip Cup

* Must successfully flip a cup.
* Each failed attempt adds **+2 seconds** to total time.
* App logs how many attempts taken.

---

#### 🏀 3. Pong Shot (Line Formation)

* 3 cups in a line (not triangle)
* Must make 1 ball into a cup.
* Each missed attempt = **+3 seconds** to total time.
* Max attempts: 6. If none made, +10 seconds penalty.

---

#### 🏃‍♂️ 4. Sprint to Finish Line

* Start/finish line timing controlled manually or via a stopwatch.
* Admin enters final run time.

---

### ⏱️ Final Scoring Formula

```text
Total Relay Time = Run Time
                 + Wedge Shot Chug Time (based on distance zone)
                 + (2s × # of Flip Cup misses)
                 + (3s × # of Pong misses or +10 if no hits)
```

🏆 Fastest total relay time wins the matchup.

---

### 📱 UI Layout (Boozelympics Tab → Golf Relay Section)

#### \[ Admin Control Panel ]

* Start Match: Player A vs Player B
* Record:

  * Distance of Wedge Shot (in feet)
  * Flip Cup Attempts (count)
  * Pong Attempts (count)
  * Final Sprint Time (in seconds)
* Auto-calculate:

  * Chug Time from wedge zone
  * Total Time
  * Winner

#### \[ Match History Section ]

* Stores:

  * Player names
  * Individual component scores
  * Total time
  * Winner
* Adds performance data to Boozelympics leaderboard

Would you like me to draft the **actual Replit schema in JSON or Firebase format**, or start designing the **frontend layout in React with Tailwind**?

Also:

**Q1:** Do you want a knockout bracket or just free callouts + leaderboard?
**Q2:** Should we store relay wins on the lifetime profile page?
**Q3:** Want to build a fun animated timer or keep it manual?
**Q4:** Do we allow retry attempts later or is it one-and-done per match?
**Q5:** Should we build a group “RELAY CHAMPS” trophy display in the app too?

Let’s take Boozelympics to legendary status 🍻⛳
