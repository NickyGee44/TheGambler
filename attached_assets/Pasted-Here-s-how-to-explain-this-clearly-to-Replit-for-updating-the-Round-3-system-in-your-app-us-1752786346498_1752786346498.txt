Here’s how to explain this clearly to **Replit** for updating the **Round 3 system** in your app, using precise language and focusing on usability, logic, and golf match fairness.

## 🛠️ Replit Implementation Instructions: **Round 3 - 6-Hole Match Play System**

---

### ✅ Summary of Round 3 Format

Each foursome plays **3 separate 6-hole 1v1 matches**. Each player will play three 6-hole matches against the others in their foursome:

* **Holes 1–6:** Player A vs Player B
* **Holes 7–12:** Player A vs Player C
* **Holes 13–18:** Player A vs Player D

Every player plays **3 six-hole matches** total (18 holes total).

Each **6-hole match** awards:

* 🟩 **1 point** to the winner
* 🟨 **0.5 points** each for a tie
* 🟥 **0 points** for a loss

**Double the points** in Round 3 (so each match is worth 2 points, not 1).
→ So a 6-hole win gives **2 points**, tie = **1 each**, loss = **0**.

### 📍 Core Features to Build

#### 1. **Live Match View in Round 3**

Display a **dynamic scorecard** for each player that:

* Shows their **current opponent** (depending on hole 1–6, 7–12, 13–18)
* Tracks the **match status** (win, tie, loss)
* Clearly displays **which holes are giving strokes** to the higher-handicap player
* Highlights **who is currently up** (e.g., “Magnatta is 1 up through 4”)
* Displays remaining holes left in the match

✅ Show this dynamically per hole in the live scoring UI.

---

#### 2. **Handicap Stroke Allocation (Per Hole)**

Use match play logic:

* For each 1v1 match, compare player handicaps
* If HCP difference = 2, lower HCP player **gives** higher HCP player **2 strokes**
* These strokes are applied to the **hardest 2 holes** of the 6 in play

📌 Use **hole handicap rating** (1–18) to identify which are the hardest holes among the 6.
Example:

> Johnny (HCP 11) vs Will Bibi (HCP 5) → Difference = 6
> Johnny receives 6 strokes
> In a 6-hole match, only 6 strokes max
> Strokes applied to the 6 most difficult holes out of the 6-hole segment

⚠️ Never apply more than **1 stroke per hole** unless the HCP difference is 18+.

---

#### 3. **Display of Stroke Holes**

Clearly show **stroke allocation** in the live scoring card:

* If a player gets a stroke on Hole 3, label that hole like:

  * “Hole 3 – 🟡 Stroke for Johnny”
* Or in table form:

| Hole | Par | HCP | Johnny (11) | Will (5) | Stroke? |
| ---- | --- | --- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| 2    | 4   | 2   | 5           | 4        | ✅       |

Bonus: Include a **“Match Notes” sidebar** showing:

* Handicap difference
* Strokes allocated
* Which holes those strokes apply to

---

#### 4. **Point Scoring + Match Resolution**

Each 6-hole match automatically:

* Tracks net score or hole-by-hole winner (depending on match type)
* Assigns **2 points** to the winner, **1 point** each for tie
* Aggregates total **Round 3 Points**
* Displays cumulative **team points** at the bottom

Store match points **per player** and **add to their pairing’s total**

---

### 🗃️ Data Needed Per Match

Store in backend or match object:

* `match_id`
* `player1_id`
* `player2_id`
* `holes`: 6-hole slice (1–6, 7–12, or 13–18)
* `hcp_diff`
* `strokes_allocated_to_player`
* `stroke_holes`: list of hole numbers
* `result`: \[Player 1 win, Player 2 win, Tie]
* `points_awarded`: \[2, 0] or \[1, 1]

---

### 🔄 Example: How a Match Works

**Players:** Will Bibi (HCP 5) vs Johnny Magnatta (HCP 11)
**Hole Segment:** Holes 1–6
**HCP Difference:** 6
**Strokes Given:** 6 strokes to Johnny
**Stroke Holes:** Holes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (if all are hard enough)

📊 Scoring:

* Will: 24 (total strokes)
* Johnny: 27 (gross), **21 (net after 6 strokes)**
  → Johnny wins, earns **2 points**

### ✅ Replit Prompt

> **Prompt for Replit:**
> “Update Round 3 logic to use 6-hole 1v1 match play format for each foursome. Each player plays three separate 6-hole matches against the other players in their group. For each match:
> – Apply match play or stroke play logic (admin can select), and determine winner based on net scores
> – Allocate strokes fairly based on HCP difference, with a max of 1 stroke per hole, using the hardest holes in the 6-hole segment
> – Display live scorecard showing the current opponent, match status, and holes where strokes are applied
> – Award 2 points for win, 1 point for tie, 0 for loss. Aggregate points at end of Round 3
> – Integrate into player and team score totals, and display who is leading each match live”
