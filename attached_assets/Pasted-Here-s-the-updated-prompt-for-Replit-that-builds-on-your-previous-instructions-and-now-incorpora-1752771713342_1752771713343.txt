Here's the updated **prompt for Replit** that builds on your previous instructions and now incorporates the concept of **yearly tournaments**, the foundation for **multi-year tracking**, and eventually, **public expansion for others to create their own versions of "The Gambler".**

### 🧾 Updated Prompt to Replit: Support for Yearly Tournaments & Future Scalability

---

We are building a private app for our annual golf tournament, **The Gambler**, with the intent to scale the platform to public use later.

The current version is for **The Gambler 2025**, and I want you to structure the code in a way that:

---

### 🔁 Multi-Year Tournament Support (Foundational Requirements)

1. **Each tournament year** is its own object/entity:

   * Store year: `2025`, `2024`, `2023`, etc.
   * Each year has:

     * Players (with names, handicaps, pairings)
     * Courses played
     * Round-by-round score and stat tracking
     * Points earned per round
     * Overall leaderboard
     * **Winning team** info (with a "champion" flag)
     * Optional side-bet results

2. Allow admin (me) to:

   * Set the current year (e.g., 2025)
   * Input past champions (e.g., 2024 winners: Jordan + Spencer)
   * Navigate to prior years’ tournaments from a dropdown or year selector

3. All golfer stats must be scoped to a **specific year**, while still rolling up into an **all-time profile** for each golfer:

   * Example:

     ```json
     "Jonathan Magnatta": {
       "handicap": 11,
       "years": {
         "2025": { rounds, stats, team, rank },
         "2024": { ... },
       },
       "all_time_stats": { total_points, average_score, GIR%, etc. }
     }
     ```

---

### 📈 Stats & Leaderboards

* Every year should have its **own leaderboard**, stats page, and round pages.
* The stats page should allow selecting a year (e.g. “View 2024 vs 2025”).

---

### 🏁 Tournament Creation Flow

For each new tournament (e.g. 2026):

* I should be able to:

  * Duplicate the previous year’s structure
  * Edit courses (e.g. Deerhurst, Muskoka Bay)
  * Add/remove players or update handicaps
  * Randomize or define pairings
  * Set start date and rounds

Eventually we will allow:

* Public tournament creators to:

  * Set up their own tournament
  * Invite players
  * Choose courses
  * Run scoring + stats
  * Host leaderboards & history

But for now, **everything is private and only for our group**.

---

### 🧱 Suggested Data Models

```json
{
  "tournaments": {
    "2025": {
      "name": "The Gambler 2025",
      "courses": ["Deerhurst Highlands", "Muskoka Bay"],
      "players": {
        "Nick Grossi": { ... },
        "Connor Patterson": { ... }
      },
      "pairings": {
        "Team 1": ["Nick Grossi", "Connor Patterson"],
        ...
      },
      "rounds": {
        "1": { "course": "Deerhurst Highlands", "score_data": {...} },
        "2": { ... },
        "3": { ... }
      },
      "champions": ["Nick Grossi", "Connor Patterson"]
    },
    "2024": { ... }
  },
  "players": {
    "Nick Grossi": {
      "handicap": 15,
      "history": {
        "2025": { stats },
        "2024": { stats }
      },
      "total_wins": 1,
      "all_time_stats": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔒 MVP Backend/Storage

For MVP, use:

* Local JSON or Supabase/Postgres DB
* Just keep the schema modular so we can plug in Firebase or MongoDB later

---

### ✅ UX Flow

1. Home page shows:

   * Current year logo + name
   * “Leaderboard”, “Stats”, “Rounds”, “Previous Years”

2. Stats and Score pages must:

   * Show stats per round
   * Allow navigating between holes and preserving data
   * Auto-calculate totals and rankings

3. In the future, allow admin creation of new years + templates.

Let me know once this structure is in place and I’ll guide UI upgrades, mobile-first views, and leaderboard UX polish.

Would you like a visual schema mock or file/folder structure to give to Replit next?
