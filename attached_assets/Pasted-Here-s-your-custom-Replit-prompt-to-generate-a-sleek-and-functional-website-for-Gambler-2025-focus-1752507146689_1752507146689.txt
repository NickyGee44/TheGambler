Build me a responsive golf tournament website called “The Gambler Cup 2025”. The site should feature the following pages and data:

1. Homepage (Landing Page)
	•	Title: “The Gambler Cup 2025”
	•	Subtitle: “Where Bogeys Buy Beers and Birdies Win Cash”
	•	Display current date and live countdown to July [insert real tournament date]
	•	Include a navigation bar with links to: Teams, Scores, Side Bets, Rules, Photos

2. Teams Page
	•	Show all 8 pairings in a grid or card layout.
	•	Each team should show:
	•	Player 1: Full name, Handicap
	•	Player 2: Full name, Handicap
	•	Total Team Handicap
	•	Sample pairing data (static for now):

[
  {"team": 1, "player1": "Nick Grossi", "hcp1": 15, "player2": "Connor Patterson", "hcp2": 3},
  {"team": 2, "player1": "Christian Hauck", "hcp1": 5, "player2": "Bailey Carlson", "hcp2": 16},
  {"team": 3, "player1": "Ben Braun", "hcp1": 6, "player2": "Nic Huxley", "hcp2": 15},
  {"team": 4, "player1": "Erik Boudreau", "hcp1": 10, "player2": "Will Bibi", "hcp2": 5},
  {"team": 5, "player1": "Nick Cook", "hcp1": 12, "player2": "Kevin Durco", "hcp2": 3},
  {"team": 6, "player1": "Spencer Reid", "hcp1": 16, "player2": "Jeff Reiner", "hcp2": 9},
  {"team": 7, "player1": "Sye Ellard", "hcp1": 18, "player2": "Austin Hassani", "hcp2": 17},
  {"team": 8, "player1": "Jordan Kreller", "hcp1": 6, "player2": "Jonathan Magnatta", "hcp2": 11}
]

	•	Include sorting by total HCP and optional “Team Power Rankings” mode.

3. Scores Page
	•	Table layout with the following:
	•	Team #
	•	Round 1 Points
	•	Round 2 Points
	•	Round 3 Points
	•	Total Points
	•	Rank
	•	Admin button to “Update Score” (basic placeholder form or dummy field)

4. Side Bets Page
	•	Each round sectioned (Round 1, 2, 3)
	•	For each round:
	•	Display list of all side bets
	•	Columns: Better, Opponent, Amount, Condition (e.g. “better round score”, “closest to pin #8”)
	•	Add button: “Place Bet” that opens a modal/form:
	•	Better name (dropdown from player list)
	•	Opponent name (dropdown)
	•	Amount
	•	Condition
	•	Result (optional field)
	•	Save to static array for now — no backend required.

5. Rules Page
	•	Breakdown of formats for each round:
	•	Round 1: Best Ball — Birdie forces opponents to drink
	•	Round 2: Scramble — Player not chosen must sip
	•	Round 3: Net Stroke Play — Each player starts at +18, subtract 1 stroke per drink
	•	How scores are calculated and how points are earned
	•	Description of The Gambler Championship Trophy

6. Photos Page
	•	Grid of 8 placeholder images with option to upload new ones
	•	Optional: allow captions

General Requirements
	•	Built in HTML/CSS/JS with simple Bootstrap for responsive layout
	•	Keep all data in JavaScript arrays for now (no database needed)
	•	Use clean, modern fonts and subtle golf-themed visual touches (green, gold, black palette)
	•	Works well on mobile and desktop

Bonus (Optional)
	•	Add a small leaderboard sidebar on every page
	•	Dark mode toggle
	•	Button that randomly selects a team to chug (fun mode)

	•	Paste this into Ghostwriter or the prompt area
	•	Once generated, tweak visuals, colors, or structure as needed
