Here's your **final Round 3 matchup table** based on your updated groups and rules:

---

### ✅ **Rules Recap**

* **Each group** plays internal 1v1 matches over **3 segments of 6 holes** (Holes 1–6, 7–12, 13–18).
* **Strokes Given = (HCP Difference × 1/3)**, rounded **down**.
* Strokes are given to the **higher handicap player**.
* Each **6-hole match awards points** (structure per your scoring system: Win = 1 pt, Tie = 0.5, Loss = 0).
* If strokes are given, apply them on the **hardest hole(s)** in that 6-hole segment.

### 🧠 Implementation Tips for Replit:

* Store matchups and strokes in a `matchups.json` or database collection with:

  ```json
  {
    "round": 3,
    "group": 1,
    "match": {
      "playerA": "Jordan Kreller",
      "hcpA": 6,
      "playerB": "Connor Patterson",
      "hcpB": 3,
      "strokes": 1,
      "recipient": "Jordan Kreller"
    }
  }
  ```
* In the live scoring interface:

  * Highlight which player **receives strokes**.
  * Show which **hole(s)** in the 6-hole segment the strokes apply to (based on course HCP rankings per hole).
  * Show a **live match score** (e.g., “1 Up”, “All Square”, “2 Down”).

---

Would you like me to generate this in a **JSON format or exportable CSV** for easy loading into your app?
Also, do you want the **hole indexes per course** (e.g., hardest holes on Deerhurst or Muskoka Bay) so we can assign exact stroke holes automatically?

---

**Next Steps / Additions (Optional):**

* Add toggles for Match Play vs Stroke Play logic
* Auto-calculate points from match outcomes per 6-hole segment
* Display match leaderboards within each group in real time

---

**Follow-Up Ideas:**

**Q1:** Should I generate JSON or Firebase schema for this?
**Q2:** Want hole difficulty rankings for Deerhurst and Muskoka Bay imported for stroke assignment?
**Q3:** Should we automatically populate Replit with player photos and bios?
**Q4:** Would you like a UI concept mockup for this match interface?
**Q5:** Do you want this matchup logic reusable for future tournaments?
